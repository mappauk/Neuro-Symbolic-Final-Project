# Neuro-Symbolic Final Project

The models for each subtask are contained in the appropriately named jupyter notebook files. Should be able to reproduce by running the cells in order. However, there are certain cells which should be skipped whether using the baseline or hierarchical models and/or evaluating against train or dev set. Their are comments associated with each of these cells to indicate which to run for which purpose. Additionally, in order to run it will require data from the SemEval Task which can be obtained on this page: https://propaganda.math.unipd.it/semeval2024task4/teampage.php?passcode=ebe2671605554ff07d8326ec8ceea81b. The annotations.zip file has text and id data for each train/validation/dev example and the corresponding image zip files have the images themselves.
